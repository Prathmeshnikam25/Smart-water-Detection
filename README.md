# Smart-water-Detection

This project addresses water quality issues and inequities through a community-centric approach. It incorporates a AI based water quality and health risk assessment tool

featuring a recommender system for potential waterborne diseases. The system utilizes remote sensing technology to monitor real-time water quality parameters. A smart  water solution is also implemented to tackle intermitted and inequitable water supply.
